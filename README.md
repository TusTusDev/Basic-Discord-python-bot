#How to Create a Discord Bot Account
In order to work with the Python library and the Discord API, we must first create a Discord Bot account.

Here are the step to creating a Discord Bot account.

1. Make sure you’re logged on to the Discord website.

2. Navigate to the application page.

3. Click on the “New Application” button.

Keep the default settings for Public Bot (checked) and Require OAuth2 Code Grant (unchecked).

Your bot has been created. The next step is to copy the token.

This token is your bot's password so don't share it with anybody. It could allow someone to log in to your bot and do all sorts of bad things.

You can regenerate the token if it accidentally gets shared.

How to Invite Your Bot to Join a Server
Now you have to get your Bot User into a server. To do this, you should create an invite URL for it.

Go to the "OAuth2" tab. Then select "bot" under the "scopes" section.
